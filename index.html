        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The history of Canada covers the period from the arrival of the
            Paleo-Indians to North America thousands of years ago to the
            present day. Prior to European colonization, the lands encompassing
            present-day Canada were inhabited for millennia by Indigenous peoples,
            with distinct trade networks, spiritual beliefs, and styles of social
            organization. Some of these older civilizations had long faded by the
            time of the first European arrivals and have been discovered through
            archeological investigations</p>

        <h2>Weather</h2>
        <p>Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary
            from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the
            country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces,
            which experience a continental climate, where daily average
            temperatures are near −15 °C (5 °F), but can drop below −40 °C
            (−40 °F) with severe wind chills.[137] In non-coastal regions,
            snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while
            in parts of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British
            Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On
            the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally
            in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the coasts, the average
            summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F), with
            temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 °C
            (104 °F).[138]</p>

        <h2>Languages</h2>
        <p>A multitude of languages are used by Canadians, with English and
            French (the official languages) being the mother tongues of
            approximately 54 percent and 19 percent of Canadians, respectively.
            [362] As of the 2021 Census, just over 7.8 million Canadians listed
            a non-official language as their mother tongue. Some of the most
            common non-official first languages include Mandarin (679,255
            first-language speakers), Punjabi (666,585), Cantonese (553,380),
            Spanish (538,870), Arabic (508,410), Tagalog (461,150), Italian
            (319,505), and German (272,865).[362] Canada's federal government
            practices official bilingualism, which is applied by the commissioner
            of official languages in consonance with section 16 of the Canadian
            Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the federal Official Languages Act.
            English and French have equal status in federal courts, Parliament,
            and in all federal institutions. Citizens have the right, where there
            is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either
            English or French and official-language minorities are guaranteed their
            own schools in all provinces and territories.[363]</p>
